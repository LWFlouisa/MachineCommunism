To implement the rules you described, you can follow these steps:

## MINIMIZE DAMAGE
Minimal damage and cooperation: Encourage participants to create and contribute content that doesn't interfere with others' creations. Implement a system that checks for compatibility between new and existing contributions. This can be achieved by using a version control system or by implementing a review process before merging contributions. sciencedaily.com provides insights into strategies that promote cooperation without non-cooperative actions.

## SCORING SYSTEM
Scoring system: Design a scoring system that rewards positive contributions and penalizes negative ones. This can be done by maintaining a database of user scores, updating them based on the compatibility of their contributions. For example, add points for each contribution that doesn't cause damage to others' work and deduct points for contributions that do. link.springer.com discusses strategies for satisfying leads to cooperation in mutual interests games.

## PRIORITY AND ENDGAME
Priority and endgame: Set a limit for the canvas size, and define the endgame as the total limit divided by the total space taken in pixels or vectors. This can be achieved by monitoring the canvas usage and notifying participants when the endgame is approaching. Encourage participants to optimize their contributions to avoid exceeding the limit.

## AI HYPE AVOIDANCE
AI Hype avoidance: Implement a system that detects and discourages attention-seeking behavior. This can be done by monitoring user activities and penalizing them if their actions are deemed disruptive to the cooperative environment.

## COOPERATIVE GAME THEORY
Cooperative game theory: Use cooperative game theory to analyze the interactions between participants and their contributions. This can help identify patterns of behavior and guide the design of incentives that promote cooperation and discourage non-cooperative actions. en.wikipedia.org provides an overview of cooperative game theory and its applications.

By following these steps, you can create a game that promotes cooperation, minimal damage, and a positive experience for all participants.
